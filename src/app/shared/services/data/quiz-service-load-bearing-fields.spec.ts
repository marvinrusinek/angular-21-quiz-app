 * (no grep hits, no obvious subscribers) but removing it broke the
 * browser. The hidden consumer was never identified.
 *
 * If you arrive at one of these tests because it's failing — STOP. The
 * field you removed has a subscriber the grep can't find. Restore the
 * field and re-read the linked memory before proceeding.
