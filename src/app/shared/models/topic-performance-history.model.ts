/**
 * A general, versioned store of RELIABLE raw topic performance.
 *
 * Why this exists separately from Interview History: eleven call sites read the
 * interview store (certificate qualification, Readiness, Topic Trends, the
 * Interview History UI, Interview Results' "latest attempt"). Writing topic-quiz
 * or practice attempts there would inflate certificate progress and skew
 * interview-only analytics. Interview History stays interview-only; this store
 * holds everything else that produces trustworthy raw counts.
 *
 * "Reliable" means RAW correct/answered counts. BestScoreService percentages are
 * deliberately NOT a source: a percentage cannot tell us how many questions were
 * answered, so it cannot satisfy the minimum-sample rule. Legacy users simply
 * begin accumulating history from their next completion — nothing is fabricated
 * from existing stored percentages.
