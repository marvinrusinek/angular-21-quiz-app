 * them to storage is different: it turns the browser into a durable answer
 * cache, which is the exact thing this migration removes from the bundle. A
 * stored answer key is no better than a shipped one.
 *
 * What survives is the user's OWN data plus their outcome: which options they
 * picked, and whether the question was right. Neither discloses the key.
 *
 * TRADEOFF: after a reload, Review can no longer highlight the correct answers
 * for a completed quiz, because that fact is deliberately no longer stored.
 * Same-session Review is unaffected — it reads the in-memory verdict history.
